### Purpose

The over arching purpose of this application is to explore the capabilities of Vue and Vuex vs React and Redux.
From Using both technologies I prefer vue alot more than I do React. This application is base off of the popular web based game 
[cookie-clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) with a spicy meme of the [ugandan knuckles](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ugandan-knuckles)
